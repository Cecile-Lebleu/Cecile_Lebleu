## What's Gatsby?

Gatsby is a framework built on React that allows for faster and easier development.

## Why should I use it?

* **Gatsby is fast.** Really fast. So fast you won't even notice the transitions between pages. If you do notice them, it was probably a design decision. In fact, Gatsby smartly pre-loads other pages of your site, for example, when a user hovers over a link.
* **It becomes like Legos.** Using React for its architecture, once you build one component, you can use it and reuse it as many times as you need. Build a few more components, plug them all together, and ta-da!
* **Get data from all over.** Get data from MarkDown, like a blog or documentation. Or link it to a CMS, like Contentful or WordPress. Or from APIs, Databases, YAML, JSON, CSV.
* **Rock solid building blocks.** Like React, Webpack, and the newest JS and CSS.
* **PWA out of the box.** Every Gatsby site is a progressive web app. How cool is that?

## What you'll need to learn

If you decide to develop website with Gatsby, you'll need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before starting. Knowing the basics of React will definitely help, as well as how to use the command line, NPM, and Git. While you're learning Gatsby, you'll inevitably learn how GraphQL works.

Depending on what data sources you will want —or need— to use, you will need to know how to manage those data sources: Markdown, a CMS, or other forms of data (like the aforementioned APIs, Databases, YAML, JSON, CSV).

## How to get started

First you'll need to [set up your development server](). Then, you can [start a new project by building pages from scratch](), or [use starters to get set up in no time](). If you're feeling more adventurous, move to [creating your own markdown-powered Gatsby blog]() — just like this one!
